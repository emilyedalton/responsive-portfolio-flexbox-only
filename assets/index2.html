        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img class="float"src="/responsive-portfolio-flexbox-only/images/Emily.png"alt="emily"height="200" width ="200"> 
        <p>As a meticulous information manager and strategic thinker who loves hands-on work, I have always been interested in problem solving. My passion for integrating technologies to improve processes, while at the same time having a keen eye for design, has led to my career to front-end web development. </p>

        <p>I have over ten years of experience in the evaluation and implementation of digital initiatives and tools in both publishing and the tech sector.As an eCommerce Analyst at Industrial Data Associates I  developed the taxonomy and schema for the first distributor of dental supplies and instruments to feature faceted search, and worked on a bottom-up restructuring of the eCommerce website for one of the largest manufacturers of electronic connectors, components and systems in the world. At Northwestern University Press, the scholarly publishing arm of Northwestern University, I increased our eCommerce profit by 30% through product discoverability enhancement via metadata channels. Additionally, I  helped increase our digital footprint by serving as project manager for Northwestern Open, a first-of-its-kind project providing free access to previously out-of-print materials to scholars and the public.
